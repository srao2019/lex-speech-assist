My mom drove me to school fifteen minutes late on Tuesday
The girl wore her hair in two braids tied with two blue bows
The mouse was so hungry he ran across the kitchen floor without even looking for humans
The tape got stuck on my lips so I could not talk anymore
The door slammed down on my hand and I screamed like a little baby
My shoes are blue with yellow stripes and green stars on the front
The mailbox was bent and broken and looked like someone had knocked it over on purpose
I was so thirsty I could not wait to get a drink of water
I found a gold coin on the playground after school today
The chocolate chip cookies smelled so good that I ate one without asking
My bandaid wasn't sticky any more so it fell off on the way to school
He had a sore throat so I gave him my bottle of water and told him to keep it
The church was white and brown and looked very old
I was so scared to go to a monster movie but my dad said he would sit with me so we went last night
Your mom is so nice she gave me a ride home today
I fell in the mud when I was walking home from school today
This dinner is so delicious I cannot stop eating
The school principal was so mean that all the children were scared of him
I went to the dentist the other day and he let me pick a prize out of the prize box
The box was small and wrapped in paper with tiny silver and red glitter dots
My dad is so funny that he told us jokes all night long and we never fell asleep
The camping trip was so awesome that I did not want to come home
Are you going to have a blue birthday cake for your next birthday
How did you know that I was going to have a peanut butter sandwich for lunch
That boy is so mean that he does not care if a door slams in your face or if he cuts in line
The moms and dads all sat around drinking coffee and eating donuts
My mom made a milkshake with frozen bananas and chocolate sauce
My pen broke and leaked blue ink all over my new dress
I got my haircut today and they did it way too short
My pet turtle Jim got out of his cage and I could not find him anywhere
The dog was so tired he fell asleep on the way to his doghouse
My mom drives a green jeep and my dad drives a black truck
Your sister is my best friend because she always shares her treats with me
My pet Roger is white and fluffy and he loves to eat carrots
Your neighbor is annoying because he cut down my trees
The tape was so sticky it got stuck to my fingers and would not come off
My glass of water broke when it fell off the table
The clock was ticking and kept me awake all night
My dad told me that I was his favorite person in the whole wide world
The chickens were running around and pecking worms out of the ground
The game looked fun but all the pieces were missing
I got my finger stuck in the door when I slammed it
I was so mad that I yelled at him at the top of my lungs
My favorite dress is ruined because I spilled ketchup on it last night
My home is bright pink and has yellow flowers growing all around it
My buddy is going to pick me up after school and give me a ride to work
I do not know where my list of friends went to invite them to my birthday party
The gum was stuck under the desk and I couldn't get it off
The baby was so cute but she was crying so loud I had to plug my ears
The flowers smelled beautiful and made the room so happy
My sister likes to eat cheese on her peanut butter sandwich and pickles on her ice cream
The alligators teeth were so scary that I ran back to the car as fast as I could
Her dress was blue with white and pink polka dots but it was ripped down the back
The puzzle took me so long to put together that I threw it in the garbage
He was driving me crazy so I told a joke and made him laugh
I started walking home and my feet got so tired I had to stop and take breaks
I piled my books in my arms and then they fell all over the floor
The dog chased the cat around the block four times
My lunch box had a peanut butter sandwich crackers juice and a cheese stick in it
I accidentally left my money in my pants pocket and it got ruined in the washer
