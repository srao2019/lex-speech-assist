Hello
Goodbye 
Good morning
Goodnight 
How are you
See you later
Who is this 
Thank you 
No thank you
Yes please
You are welcome
Sure I hope so 
Take care 
I am ready 
Not today
Can you get that 
You are kidding 
Why do you ask 
Do you see it 
I am not sure
Could you get that 
Do you know him 
Happy Birthday
Not too good 
It is over there 
Where is the paper
Please go to the store 
Better than before 
It is time to go
Who is on the phone 
I have to go to the bathroom 
I am not feeling well
Let us go out tonight
How was your day
Let us have chicken for dinner tonight
It was nice to meet you
Could you help me with this
Did you get that
I do not need any help
I am feeling happy 
I am feeling sad
I am feeling angry
Where are you going
Who was that
Have a good day
What time is it
Would you do that for me
It is so good to see you
Did you lock the door
That was so nice of you
Could you turn off the television
Are all of the windows closed
Is the air conditioning on
What will you have to drink
I would like to order a pizza
What time will you be home
What is the weather like outside
I am hungry
Turn off the lights when you come up
What time will you be home
Could you direct me to the restrooms
I would like a cup of coffee
I would like pizza for dinner tonight
I want to watch television
Her shirt was blue
His pants are green
Her favorite color is purple
Today is Monday
Today is Tuesday
Today is Wednesday
Today is Thursday
Today is Friday
Today is Saturday
Today is Sunday
I am coming home on Saturday
There is no school on Monday
The dog has brown fur
The cat has gray fur
The pizza has pineapple on it
It is sunny outside
It is raining
It is cloudy
It is very cold outside
It is too hot outside
The temperature is eighty degrees
I want to travel to Asia
Can I get you anything
I cleaned my room
I swept the floor
Mom told me to do the dishes
Welcome home
I am in your class
We are the same age
I like ice cream too
The train was blue and fast
The month is December
Christmas is my favorite holiday
